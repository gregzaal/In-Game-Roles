In-Game Roles Discord Bot
=========================

A discord bot that assigns roles for the game that members are currently playing, so that they are grouped up in the member list.


TODO
----

- Periodically purge game roles (and items in gamelist) that have no players, but only if the role hasn't been modified since creation.
